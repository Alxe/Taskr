Taskr
===

**Taskr** is born as a school project by _Alejandro Núñez Pérez_ as his final test for the 2 year course of
Multiplatform Application Development in the school IES Saladillo, located in Algeciras, Cádiz, Spain.

The project is mainly aimed as a Django-based web service that lets users manage (you guessed) _tasks_. This bare idea
is to be expanded with the addition of a **group system**, where many users can post their tasks and have other users
mark them as completed, a **tag system**, allowing users tag their to provide a better context, and a **public API**
for 3rd party developers to design applications that interact with Taskr.
